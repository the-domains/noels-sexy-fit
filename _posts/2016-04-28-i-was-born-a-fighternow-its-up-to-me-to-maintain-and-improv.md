description: '“I was born a fighter…Now it’s up to me to maintain & improve who I am, right now!! I can’t go back and change yesterday, or even a minute ago. I can only move forward. At times false beliefs of myself, of the world, who I am or who I can be… may try to get me down, but no longer will I give in!!! No longer will I be a victim, to anything, myself included. I am a survivor, a solider, a fighter. I have been redeemed through Jesus and his love for me. I will never give up and never give in. I am solution focused!!” Ms. Merry, Fitness Motivator.'
